# travel-typerighter

A little experiment to see if it's possible to take [Typerighter](https://github.com/guardian/typerighter/pulls) to more places.

Based on the excellent blog post describing the [Grammarly extension](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/engineering/making-grammarly-feel-native-on-every-website/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
